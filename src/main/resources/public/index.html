                        <p>Your program receives a string of uppercase characters – the magic phrase Bilbo needs to spell out – and must output a sequence of characters, each representing an action for Bilbo to perform.
                        These actions will have Bilbo move around in the forest, interacting with the different stones.</p>
                        <p>The forest Bilbo is trapped works as follows:</p>
                        <p>The forest contains 30 zones.</p>
                        <p>Bilbo can move left and right through the zones which are all aligned. He does this when he receives a less-than <strong><</strong> or greater-than <strong>></strong> sign.</p>
                        <p>The last zone is connected to the first zone, effectively creating a looping area.</p>
                        <p>Each zone contains a magic stone upon which is inscribed a rune with which Bilbo can interact.</p>

                        <p>Runes work as follows:</p>
                        <p>Every rune is represented by a letter of the alphabet <strong>(A-Z)</strong> or an <strong>empty space</strong>.</p>
                        <p>All runes start out as a space.</p>
                        <p>Bilbo can change the value of the letter on the rune by rolling back and forth through the possibilities. He does this when he receives a plus + or minus - character.</p>
                        <p>The letter after Z is space. The letter after space is A.</p>
                        <p>Bilbo can trigger a rune. This will add the displayed letter to the phrase he is spelling out. He does this when he receives a dot . character.</p>
                        <p>One rune can be triggered several times.</p>

                        <p><strong>YOU WIN IF THE MAGIC PHRASE IS SPELLED OUT CORRECTLY AT THE END OF BILBO'S MOVE SEQUENCE.</strong></p>

                        <p>You lose if:</p>
                        <p>At the end of Bilbo's move sequence, the wrong message is displayed.</p>
                        <p>Bilbo performs 4000 moves or more in the forest.</p>
                        <p>You do not supply Bilbo with a valid sequence of actions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

                        <p>If Bilbo needs to spell out the word AB, you could give him the instructions <strong>+.+..</strong> He will:</p>
                        <p>Make the first rune go from space to A.</p>
                        <p>Trigger the A.</p>
                        <p>Make rune go from A to B.</p>
                        <p>Trigger the B.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, you could also give him the instructions <strong>+.>++.</strong> to achieve the same result. Experiment with different tactics!</p>

                            <h4>Extended instructions</h4>
                            <p><strong>For expert CodinGamers (don't bother with this until you've really tried the rest): Loops.</strong></p>
                            <p>These actions are also available:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>[: If the current rune contains a space, skip all instructions up to the matching closing bracket ], otherwise continue normally.</li>
                                <li>]: If the current rune contains a space, continue normally, otherwise perform the instructions starting from the matching opening bracket [.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This makes it possible to have Bilbo perform more actions with less characters for your program to output.</p>

                            <p>For example, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (A x26) can be achieved with a simple
                            <strong>+..........................</strong>as well as with <strong>+>-[<.>-].</strong></p>

                            <p>Experiment with different techniques, if you have the guts!</p>
